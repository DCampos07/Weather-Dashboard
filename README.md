# Weather-Dashboard
#### A simple weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

This page will run tasks in the browser while retrieving data from other applications APIâ€™s and using it in the context of their own. 
While using the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data for cities I was tasked with:

* When user enters a city in the search bar, they are presented with current and future weather conditions, and they city is added to the search history.
* User needs to be able to access any city from a previous search.
* The user will see displayed on the screen: city name, date, an icon representing the current weather conditions, temperature, humidity level, wind speed, UV index.
* When using viewing the future conditions for a city then the user is presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity.
